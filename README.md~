# Effective Degrees of Freedom of the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient under Serial Correlation

## Highlights
* Autocorrelation biases the standard error of Pearson's correlation and breaks the variance-stabilising property of Fisher's transformation.
* Severity of resting state fMRI autocorrelation varies systematically with region of interest size, and is heterogeneous over subjects.
* Commonly used methods (see Aux directory) to adjust correlation standard errors are themselves biased when true correlation is non-zero due to a confounding effect.
* We propose a ?xDF? method to provide accurate estimates of the variance of Pearson?s correlation -- before or after Fisher?s transformation -- that considers auto-correlation of each time series as well as instantaneous and lagged cross-correlation.
* Accounting for the autocorrelation in resting-state functional connectivity considerably alters the graph theoretical description of human connectome.
