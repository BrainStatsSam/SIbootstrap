## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Collection of code to calculate the bias at the location of peaks and
reproduce figures from:

## Folder Structure <a name="folderstruct"></a>

Bias Calculations contains the functions used to implement the bootstrap and
data-splitting.

Linear Modelling contains MVlm_multivar which fits a multivariate linear model 
at every voxel (when the total number of subjects can fit into memory). 
It also includes examples of how large scale linear models can be run 

Simulations contains the 

Real Data contains

Statistical Functions contains the general statistical functions used in modelling.

## Dependencies <a name="dependencies"></a>
Collection of scripts to implement the xDF method introduced in

RFTtoolbox package. This can be downloaded at: https://github.com/BrainStatsSam/RFTtoolbox.
