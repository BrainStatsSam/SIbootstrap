%Calculating the mean of a non-central t distribution and how it affects
%our results.

v = 50;
(1/sqrt(v))*(1 - 3/(4*v-1))^(-1)

%Write out the distribution for betahat/sigmahat etc. And check that
%everything is as you expect it to be.

%Do the one-sample spatial t-stat stuff so that you can test things work in
%that scenario! And test to see if a correction needs to be made.
